==========================================================================================

Photo-Realistic single image super-resolution using Generative Adversarial
Network (SRGAN) implemented using PyTorch. Source paper: [Photo-Realistic Single
Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial
Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf)

SRGAN Architecture

Dataset
-------

[DIVerse 2K - DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) resolution high
quality images dataset and
[VOC2012](https://www.kaggle.com/huanghanchina/pascal-voc-2012) dataset were
both randomly sampled and was used as training and validation set for this
project. Download the Train Data (HR images) and Validation Data (HR Images) zip
files and extract them under **data** folder.

Results obtained
----------------

Left image is Low Resolution Image, Middle image is original High Resolution
Image, and the right image is the Generated Super-Resolution Image.

Usage
-----

Use bash terminal or Powershell or Command Prompt

### For training

Change the training configuration (Epochs, Batch Size, Crop Size, Upscale
Factor) in the script.

`python train.py`

### For testing

Change the testing configuration (Upscale Factor & Trained Model path) in the
script.

`python test.py`

Check this [colab
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yWu4GAfAH6P8nQNVXCSA8mUPaBXOz2SP?usp=sharing)
for simple prediction pipeline.

Pretrained model
----------------

Pretrained model is available under the [trained_models](trained_models/)
folder.

Module Description
------------------

-   [models.py](models.py) - Contains the implementation of Residual Block,
    UpSample Block, Generator, and Discriminator.

-   [losses.py](losses.py) - Contains the implementation of generator loss
    function (Image loss, Perpetual loss, Total Variation loss, and Adversarial
    loss. Have used WGAN).

-   [utils.py](utils.py) - Contains Transformation fucntions and custom Dataset
    classes for training and validation sets.

-   [pyssim.py](pyssim.py) - Contains functions to calculate Structural
    similarity scores and Peak Signal to Noise ratio of given images.

-   [train.py](train.py) - Training script to train the SRGAN model.

-   [test.py](test.py) - A simple test script to convert low resolution image to
    super resolution using the trained model.
